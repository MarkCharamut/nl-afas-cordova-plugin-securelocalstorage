Secure localStorage for Cordova
==========================
This plugin will wrap the localStorage api and store data encrypted using IOS keychain or Android keystore. This is no protection for hackers who have physical/root access to 
your phone. Goal: On unrooted phones protect against reading/writing (without using the host app) the contents stored in the the SecureLocalStorage..
Use it to store temporary sensitive data which will survice an app exit/shutdown.
